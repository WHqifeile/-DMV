"PONY.AI, INC.",AVT032,4/23/2024,3LN6L5MU9KR623692,No,Yes,Operator,Street,"On April 23, 2024, a Pony.ai autonomous vehicle (AV) scraped a curb on Lakeview Blvd near the intersection of Lakeview Blvd & Gateway Blvd in Fremont, CA. The vehicle was operating in supervised autonomous (""Drivered"") mode. There were no other vehicles, pedestrians, or road users involved.

Following the incident, the safety operator promptly drove the AV, in manual mode, to Pony.ai's Fremont office. There were no injuries
reported, and the police were not called."
"PONY.AI, INC.",AVT032,5/15/2024,3LN6L5MU9KR623692 ,No,Yes,Operator,Street,"On May 15, 2024, the front right bumper of a Pony.ai autonomous vehicle (AV) scraped against a flexible plastic traffic pylon on Auto Mall Pkwy near the intersection of Auto Mall Pkwy & Grimmer Blvd, in Fremont, CA. The vehicle was operating in supervised autonomous (Drivered)  mode. There were no other vehicles, pedestrians, or road users involved.

Following the incident, the safety operator pulled over in a safe location and confirmed there was only minor cosmetic damage to the front bumper of the AV. The safety operator then promptly drove the vehicle, in manual mode, to Pony.ais Fremont office. There were no injuries, and the police were not called."
"PONY.AI, INC.",AVT032,05/28/2024,KM8K23AG6MU127152,No,Yes,Operator,Street,"An Autonomous Driving Vehicle (ADV) operating in supervised autonomous (""Drivered"") mode stopped at a T-intersection intending to turn left. As the ADV began accelerating, the safety operator observed a rapidly approaching truck from the left on the target road. Concerned that the ADV was not accelerating quickly enough, as a precaution, the safety operator manually intervened, stopping the ADV outside the intersection.

The incident did not involve a failure of the autonomous technology.  Upon review, the autonomous vehicle correctly detected and projected the trajectory of the approaching truck.  However, the experienced safety operator determined that, in his judgment, the apparent trajectories of the two vehicles could risk a collision.  In an abundance of caution and in accordance the safety operators training, he intervened to disengage the system and take control of the vehicle."
